# 🤖 Automation Flow Builder: Detailed Guide

The **Automation Flow Builder** is like hiring a digital employee who never sleeps. It allows you to create "Smart Rules" that handle your WhatsApp messages automatically.

## 1. What is Automation?
Automation is a **Set of Instructions** you give to WBIZZ. You tell the system: *"IF a customer does this, THEN respond with that."* It removes the need for a human to be present for every single customer interaction.

## 2. Why use Automation?
- **Speed (24/7 Availability):** Customers hate waiting. Automation gives them an answer in 0.5 seconds, even at 3:00 AM on a Sunday.
- **Consistency:** The robot never makes a typo, never forgets to say "Thank you," and never gets tired.
- **Lead Capture:** If someone messages you for the first time, automation can automatically save their number and tag them as a "New Lead" in your CRM.
- **Cost Efficiency:** One automation flow can handle thousands of customers, saving you from having to hire extra staff for basic support.

## 3. How does it work? (The Engine)

### The "Trigger" (The Event)
Every automation starts with a **Trigger**. This is the event that wakes up the system. Examples include:
- A customer sends their first message.
- A customer types a specific keyword (like "Help" or "Demo").
- A button is clicked in a WhatsApp message.

### The "Brain" (The AI & Logic)
Once triggered, the "Brain" makes a decision:
- **Condition:** It checks a rule (e.g., "Is this customer already in our database?").
- **AI Processing:** Our "Neural Bridge" uses AI to understand the *intent* of the message even if the user didn't use a specific keyword.

### The "Action" (The Result)
Finally, the system performs the work:
- **Send Message:** Replies to the customer with text, images, or a list.
- **Update CRM:** Moves the customer to a new stage on your Kanban board.
- **Delay:** Waits for a specific time to make the conversation feel more natural.

## 4. Visualizing the Flow
Our builder uses a **Visual Map** (nodes and lines). You can see the path a customer takes—from their first "Hi" to the moment they are successfully converted into a lead. It makes complex business logic easy to understand at a glance.
