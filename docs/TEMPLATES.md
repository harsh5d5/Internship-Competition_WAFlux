# 📝 WhatsApp Templates: Detailed Guide

**Templates** are the "Building Blocks" of professional WhatsApp Business communication. They are pre-designed message formats that ensure your business looks trustworthy and official.

## 1. What are Templates?
Templates are **Verified Message Layouts**. Unlike personal WhatsApp where you can type anything to anyone at any time, the official WhatsApp Business API requires that you use a "Template" whenever you want to start a conversation with a customer who hasn't messaged you recently.

## 2. Why use Templates?
- **Delivery Guarantee:** Meta (Facebook) prioritizes template messages to ensure they don't get marked as spam.
- **Rich Interaction:** Templates can include professional **Buttons** (like "Visit Website," "Call Now," or "Yes/No") which make it very easy for customers to respond.
- **Professionalism:** Using standardized templates ensures your brand voice is consistent across all your marketing.
- **Organization:** You can have different sets of templates for different goals: "Welcome Messages," "Payment Reminders," "Shipping Updates," etc.

## 3. How does it work? (The Lifecycle)

### Stage 1: Design & Registration
You create a template in your **Meta Business Suite**. You define the text, the buttons, and where the "Variables" (like {{name}}) should go. Meta then reviews it to make sure it follows their safety rules.

### Stage 2: Sync with WBIZZ
Once approved, WBIZZ automatically fetches these templates. You can see them all in the **Templates tab** of your dashboard.

### Stage 3: Dynamic Filling (Magic Variables)
When you go to send a message, WBIZZ shows you the template with empty spots. You don't have to fill these manually! Our system "injects" the customer's data into the template instantly as it sends.

### Stage 4: Interactive Buttons
When the customer receives the template, they see clear buttons at the bottom.
- **Quick Reply:** A button that sends a specific answer back (e.g., "Interested!"). This can trigger an **Automation**.
- **Call to Action:** A button that opens your website or starts a phone call.

## 4. Key Rules to Remember
- **Approval Time:** Meta usually takes a few minutes to 24 hours to approve a new template.
- **No Spamming:** Templates are designed for high-quality communication. If too many users report your template as spam, Meta may disable it.
- **Variables:** Use `{{1}}`, `{{2}}`, etc., for dynamic data like names, order IDs, or dates.
