# 📢 Marketing Campaigns: Detailed Guide

The **Campaigns** feature is your tool for "Broadcasting." It allows you to send targeted messages to a large group of people simultaneously through WhatsApp.

## 1. What is a Campaign?
Think of a Campaign as a **Digital Announcement**. Instead of texting 100 people one-by-one, a campaign lets you create one master message and hit "Send" once. It uses the official WhatsApp Business API to ensure your messages reach your customers' phones safely and professionally.

## 2. Why use Campaigns?
- **Massive Time Savings:** Sending 500 messages manually could take all day. A campaign does it in minutes.
- **Engagement:** WhatsApp messages have a 98% open rate—much higher than email.
- **Personalization:** Even though you are sending to a group, the campaign can automatically insert the customer's name into each message, making it feel personal.
- **Promotions:** Perfect for telling your customers about a "Weekend Sale," "New Arrival," or "Festive Discount."

## 3. How does it work? (The Flow)

### Step A: Building your Audience
First, you select who should receive the message. You can choose all your contacts or a specific group of people (like "New Leads" or "Delhi Customers").

### Step B: Choosing your "Flyer" (The Template)
On WhatsApp, bulk messages must use "Templates" (pre-approved message formats). You select the design and wording you want to use.

### Step C: Personalization (Variable Filling)
If your template says "Hello {{1}}, welcome to WBIZZ!", our system automatically replaces `{{1}}` with the actual name of each customer from your database.

### Step D: Execution (The Dispatch)
Once you hit send:
1. WBIZZ connects to the **Meta (Facebook) Cloud servers**.
2. Each message is processed through your official WhatsApp Business number.
3. You get a live report showing how many messages were **Sent**, **Delivered**, and **Read**.

## 4. Pro-Tips for Success
- **Respect Boundaries:** Don't send messages too often (2-3 times a week is usually best).
- **Clear Value:** Make sure your message has a clear "What's in it for me?" for the customer.
- **Timing:** Use the Analytics on your Dashboard to find the hour when most of your customers are online before launching a campaign.
